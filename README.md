# Adversarial Robustness of TabPFN

Master's thesis research on adversarial attacks against TabPFN compared to traditional GBDT models.

## 🎯 Main Finding

**TabPFN is 1.7x more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than GBDTs (XGBoost, LightGBM)**

## 📊 Results (Wine Dataset)

| Model | Attack Success Rate | Robustness Score |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| LightGBM | 42.9% | 0.688 |
| XGBoost | 46.7% | 0.671 |
| TabPFN | 73.3% | 0.604 |

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run experiment
python run_wine_experiment.py
```
