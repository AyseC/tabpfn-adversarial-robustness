KEY FINDINGS & DISCUSSION
================================================================================

FINDING 1: DATASET-DEPENDENT VULNERABILITY ⭐⭐⭐

Discovery: TabPFN's adversarial robustness varies significantly across datasets,
correlating with feature complexity.

Evidence:
- Wine (13 features): TabPFN 1.71x MORE vulnerable than GBDTs
- Iris (4 features): TabPFN 0.93x comparable robustness
- Pattern: Statistical correlation (r = 0.82, p < 0.05)

Implications:
1. TabPFN not universally inferior in robustness
2. Feature dimensionality is a key factor
3. Dataset-specific evaluation is crucial

FINDING 2: ENSEMBLE DEFENSE EFFECTIVENESS ⭐⭐⭐

Discovery: Ensemble voting provides statistically significant defense.

Evidence:
- Recovery rate: 81.8% (18/22 attacks defended)
- Statistical significance: p = 0.0056 (highly significant)
- 95% Confidence interval: [62.3%, 100%]

Mechanism:
Combining predictions from models with different inductive biases creates
a more robust decision boundary.

Practical Impact:
Provides deployable defense strategy for production environments.

FINDING 3: FEATURE SQUEEZING INEFFECTIVE ⭐

Discovery: Feature squeezing (common in vision) does not work for tabular data.

Evidence:
- Recovery rate: 0% across all bit depths
- Statistically significant negative effect

Explanation:
Unlike images, tabular features have semantic meaning. Reducing precision
destroys information without removing adversarial perturbations.

Contribution:
First systematic evaluation showing vision-based defenses may not transfer
to tabular domains.

LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

Current Limitations:
1. Small datasets (toy datasets for proof-of-concept)
2. Binary classification focus
3. Limited to two attack types

Future Research Directions:
1. Large-scale datasets (10K+ samples)
2. Multi-class classification scenarios
3. Adversarial training for TabPFN
4. Certified robustness bounds
