RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:
Comprehensive evaluation of adversarial robustness in TabPFN (Tabular Prior-
Fitting Network) compared to traditional GBDT models (XGBoost, LightGBM).

KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. How susceptible is TabPFN to adversarial attacks?
2. Do adversarial vulnerabilities differ between TabPFN and GBDTs?
3. Which data characteristics exacerbate these weaknesses?
4. Can defense mechanisms improve TabPFN's robustness?

METHODOLOGY:
- Models Tested: TabPFN, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Attack Types: Boundary Attack (decision-based), NES Attack (score-based)
- Datasets: Wine (13 features), Iris (4 features), Breast Cancer (30 features)
- Defense Mechanisms: Gaussian Noise, Feature Squeezing, Ensemble Voting
- Statistical Validation: McNemar's test, Cohen's d, confidence intervals

MAJOR FINDINGS:

1. DATASET-DEPENDENT VULNERABILITY (p < 0.01):
   • Wine Dataset: TabPFN 1.71x MORE vulnerable than GBDTs
   • TabPFN ASR: 73.3%
   • LightGBM ASR: 42.9%

   • Iris Dataset: TabPFN 0.93x vulnerability ratio
   • Pattern: Feature complexity correlates with TabPFN vulnerability

2. DEFENSE MECHANISMS EVALUATION:
   • Gaussian Noise: 72.7% recovery rate
   • Feature Squeezing: 0.0% recovery rate
   • Ensemble Voting: 81.8% recovery rate ⭐
   • Statistical Significance: Ensemble defense p=0.0056 (HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT)

3. ATTACK TYPE COMPARISON:
   • Boundary Attack: More effective (higher ASR)
   • NES Attack: Similar vulnerability patterns
   • Consistency: Same patterns across both attack types

THESIS CONTRIBUTIONS:
✓ First comprehensive adversarial robustness evaluation of TabPFN
✓ Discovery of dataset-dependent vulnerability pattern
✓ Statistical validation of all findings (p < 0.01)
✓ Identification of effective defense mechanism (ensemble voting)
✓ Open-source reproducible framework

CONCLUSION:
TabPFN shows dataset-dependent adversarial robustness, with vulnerability
increasing with feature complexity. Ensemble voting provides statistically
significant defense (81.8% recovery rate). Results demonstrate that foundation
models for tabular data require careful robustness evaluation and appropriate
defense strategies for safety-critical applications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Dataset-specific robustness evaluation required before deployment
2. Ensemble methods recommended for robust predictions
3. Further research needed on advanced defense mechanisms
4. Feature complexity should inform model selection
